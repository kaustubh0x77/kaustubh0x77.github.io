I'm a third year Computer Science student at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. I plan to pursue a career in Computer Science, most probably specialising in Systems. I'm trying to figure out which parts of CS I want to specialize in. 

I've interned at IIIT Delhi in the summer of 2018. Read the blog post about my experience [here](http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/blog/2018/09/21/a-summer-at-precog/) 

At IIIT D, I worked on a project to identify the spoken languages in 5 second audio clips. Another project that I worked on explored using Markov Decision Processes for IoT device state automation. The problem of automatically changing the state of IoT devices fascinates me, and I try to work on it once in a while. Working in a research lab very early in my career was a unique experience. I was advised by [Prof. Arun Balaji Buduru](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/arunb) and [Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/pk).
